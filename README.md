# Sudoku Generator

First personal project built in the context of the back-end career path from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Description

A program that generates a valid random Sudoku grid and renders it in HTML. Each time that the user refreshes the page, a new grid gets generated.

The next step in this project will be to randomly remove numbers from the grid and make it an actual puzzle.

## Setup

1. Install Python and ensure that it's available from your path.

    ```shell
    python --version
    ```

2. Install Pipenv and ensure that it's available from your path.

    ```shell
    pipenv -v
    ```

3. Install the required packages.

    ```shell
    pipenv install
    ```

4. Start your local server.

    ```shell
    pipenv run start
    ```

5. Access the project from your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Objective
